# Resque-Squad-Tracking

A system where the patients along with the hospital can track the medical emergency vehicles whenever called for emergencies. The goal of this project is to provide transparency between patients and the hospital management. When an ambulance is being sent by the hospital control room to seriously ill patients in the case of emergencies, the mobile communication system that we are developing would improve the speed and accuracy of ambulance/resque squad tracking.

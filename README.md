# Resque-Squad-Tracking

A system where the patients along with the hospital can track the medical emergency vehicles whenever called for emergencies. The goal of this project is to provide transparency between patients and the hospital management. When an ambulance is being sent by the hospital control room to seriously ill patients in the case of emergencies, the mobile communication system that we are developing would improve the speed and accuracy of ambulance/resque squad tracking. In this project, we use advance tracking and ambulance monitoring system via GPS technology using Google Maps API. It consists of Android software to receive real-time location via GPS receiver on the ambulance driverâ€™s Android smartphone.Tools used are Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA. The back end used in our project is SQLite and front end used is XML.  
The official language for Android development is Java.

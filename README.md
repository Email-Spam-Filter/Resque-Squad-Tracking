It consists of Android software to receive real-time location via GPS receiver on the ambulance driverâ€™s Android smartphone.Tools used are Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA.The back end used in our project is SQLite and front end used is XML.   


This is a real-time cloud-based tracking system in which the patients along with the hospital can track the location of the ambulance using the firebase cloud which is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) from Google Cloud Platform. It uses Global Positioning System (GPS) to track the latitude and longitude of the ambulance's current position.

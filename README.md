# Resque-Squad-Tracking

This is a real-time cloud-based tracking system in which the patients along with the hospital can track the location of the ambulance using the firebase cloud which is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) from Google Cloud Platform. It uses Global Positioning System (GPS) to track the latitude and longitude of the ambulance's current position. This application provide transparency between patients and the hospital management. When an ambulance is being sent by the hospital control room to the seriously ill patients in the case of emergencies, the mobile communication system that we have developed would improve the speed and accuracy of ambulance/rescue squad tracking. This system takes advantage of the GPS technology using Google Maps API to receive real-time location via GPS receiver on the ambulance driverâ€™s android's application.
